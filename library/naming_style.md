Naming Style Guidelines
=======================

General guidelines:

* Generally use lowercase with underscores.

* Brevity is a virtue, but it is more important to have the expressions easy to read, understand, and remember. 

* Be consistent with names and abbreviations.

* When ordering the arguments and deciding which arguments to make implicit, remember that functions and theorems will often be partially applied; think about common usage. 

* Use lower case for important types, like "nat", "int", "real".

* Use uppercase for structures and classes, like "Group" and "AbelianGroup".

* Use "eq" for equations, like "abs_nonneg_eq".

* Use "iff" for equivalences, like "lt_iff_not_le".

* Use "imp" for implications, like "lt_imp_le".

* For properties of an object or operation, put the object or operation first, as 
in "add_comm", "mul_distrib".

* Otherwise, for mnemonic purposes, it is often helpful to approximate the statement
itself, such as "succ_poss", "le_imp_lt_or_eq", "lt_imp_not_le".


Some specifics:

* Use pos, neg, nonneg, nonpos.

* Favor lt, le over gt, ge.
